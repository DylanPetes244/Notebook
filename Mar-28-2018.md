Going over Module 4
 - Provide "meaning" to your art
 - How can I make this AR experience on history of disability "meaningful" to Carleton students? (Possible q.)
 - Relevant and impactful (Make history "matter")
 - **MAKE SURE to refer back to Core Concepts (Open notebooks, computing resources, etc.) 
 - Ex) Merged Terry Fox, by putting him on a centaur's body
   - By taking away aesthetic legs from body, takes away part of his "legacy" (Changes meaning)
   - If they are 3D printing, makes it "different"
 - Ex2) Civil rights doing "angel" salute
   - Prof: Who was the person in the model? (Important)
 - Putting 3D Model back into physical world 
   - Questions to consider: Cultural appropriation, does it alter memory? (Put this in paradata)
   - Ex) Make a section on "Ethical Implications" on paradata (Good idea!!!)
     - This would be good to put on a portfolio!! (For masters program, job application, i.e.)
 - CNN (Convolutional neural network)** Review this 
   - Helps pull digital stuff back into physical world
   - Ex) "Ottawa by Night" picture: Merged w. Imaginary soundscape (Gives sound experience)
   - Ex2) Groups of faces (W. drum sound in background)
   - Prof: Take bunch of images have so far, feed into Imaginary soundscape, how does AI hallunciate the real world
   - Ex3) Jesus's crucifixtion (Sound of hammer in background)
   - Ex4) Picture of shelves of skulls (Sounds of clock ticking in background)
   - Website: http://imaginarysoundscape.qosmo.jp/ (Make sure to put #2 in website if you want different experience)
 - Generominos (Turns physical things to digital data to create artistic experiences)
   - Has inputs and outputs
   - Ex) Has button and music link, and then comes out of the speaker 
      - Analysis: If putting this in Module 4, explain in paradata about "transformation"
   - Website: generominos/editor-dev
   - Prof: Input- ideal geometry, turn it into light show, workflow prototype system
 - Will also add this info to FAQ
 - Prof final thoughts: Always, always make sure to refer to readings, relevance 
   
 Reflection
 - Using Generomino: Experimenting, trying to add lines, see how it works
   - Trying different options
   - Ex) Prof: Creates Card about Module 3, could maybe create card about metadata
   - Can also create random cards 
 - Using imaginary soundscape: Can also experiment w. different real world objects!!
