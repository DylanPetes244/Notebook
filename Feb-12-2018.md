What brings us back to the digital
- Problems for museums (Bad lighting, i.e.) 
- Position of Canadian museums** (Good for Module 2: Prof believes they have no postion at all)
- ^^ Put this in Notebook for Module 2, write a discussion about this!!

Misuse (A bigger fear)
- (Come back to this point)
- Module 2: Think about the full bioography of object, am I doing damage? Think about the culture
- Museums answering these questions require infrastructure **on presentation 
- Example) Dan Pett 
- Prof: Read article that he posted ** (Important for Module 2)

Michael Carter
- 3D Model (verticies)
- Embed all information about the object 
- Example) Mixed Antinous and "Homer" from the Simpsons (Trying to make statement who icons are, from Ancient and modern culture)
- Can access Carter's slides (Should be on presentation)
